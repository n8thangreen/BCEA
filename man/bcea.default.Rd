\description{
Compute a Bayesian cost-effectiveness analysis of two or more interv_names.

\details{
INPUTS:
1. Two objects (`e`,`c`). These can be directly computed in a simulation object `sim` from JAGS/BUGS, 
   or derived by postprocessing of `sim` in R. The objects (`e`,`c`) have dimension (`n_sim` x number of 
   interv_names) and contain n_sim simulated values for the measures of effectiveness and costs 
   for each intervention being compared. 
2. The reference intervention as a numeric value. Each intervention is a column in the matrices `e` 
   and `c` so if `ref` = 1 the first column is assumed to be associated with the reference intervention. 
   Intervention 1 is assumed the default reference. All others are considered comparators.
3. A string vector "interv_names" including the names of the interv_names. If none is provided 
   then labels each as "intervention1",...,"interventionN".
4. The value `Kmax` which represents the maximum value for the willingness to pay parameter. If none 
   is provided, then it is assumed `Kmax` = 50000.
5. A(n optional) vector wtp including the values of the willingness to pay grid. If not specified
   then `bcea` will construct a grid of 501 values from 0 to `Kmax`. This option is useful when 
   performing intensive computations (e.g. for the EVPPI)
