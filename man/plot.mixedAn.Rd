\title{Summary Plot of the Health Economic Analysis When the Mixed Analysis is
Considered}
\usage{
\method{plot}{mixedAn}(x, y.limits = NULL, pos = c(0, 1), graph = c("base", "ggplot2"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{mixedAn}, given as output of the call to
the function \code{\link{mixedAn}}.}

\item{y.limits}{Range of the y-axis for the graph. The default value is
\code{NULL}, in which case the maximum range between the optimal and the
mixed analysis scenarios is considered.}

\item{pos}{Parameter to set the position of the legend. Can be given in form
of a string \code{(bottom|top)(right|left)} for base graphics and
\code{bottom|top|left|right} for ggplot2. It can be a two-elements vector,
which specifies the relative position on the x and y axis respectively, or
alternatively it can be in form of a logical variable, with \code{FALSE}
indicating to use the default position and \code{TRUE} to place it on the
bottom of the plot. Default value is \code{c(0,1)}, that is in the topleft
corner inside the plot area.}

\item{graph}{A string used to select the graphical engine to use for
plotting. Should (partial-)match the two options \code{"base"} or
\code{"ggplot2"}. Default value is \code{"base"}.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to methods, such as graphical parameters
(see \code{\link{par}}).}
}
\value{
\item{evi}{ A ggplot object containing the plot. Returned only if
\code{graph="ggplot2"}. } The function produces a graph showing the
difference between the ''optimal'' version of the EVPI (when only the most
cost-effective intervention is included in the market) and the mixed
strategy one (when more than one intervention is considered in the market).
}
\description{
Compares the optimal scenario to the mixed case in terms of the EVPI.
