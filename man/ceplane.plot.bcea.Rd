\usage{
\method{ceplane.plot}{bcea}(he, wtp = 25000, pos = c(0, 1), graph = c("base", "ggplot2"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{he}{A \code{bcea} object containing the results of the Bayesian
modelling and the economic evaluation.}

\item{wtp}{The value of the willingness to pay parameter. Not used if
\code{graph = "base"} for multiple comparisons.}

\item{pos}{Parameter to set the position of the legend; for a single
comparison plot, the ICER legend position. Can be given in form of a string
\code{(bottom|top)(right|left)} for base graphics and
\code{bottom|top|left|right} for ggplot2. It can be a two-elements vector,
which specifies the relative position on the x and y axis respectively, or
alternatively it can be in form of a logical variable, with \code{FALSE}
indicating to use the default position and \code{TRUE} to place it on the
bottom of the plot. Default value is \code{c(1,1)}, that is the topright
corner inside the plot area.}

\item{graph}{A string used to select the graphical engine to use for
plotting. Should (partial-)match the two options \code{"base"} or
\code{"ggplot2"}. Default value is \code{"base"}.}

\item{...}{If \code{graph = "ggplot2"} and a named theme object is supplied,
 it will be added to the ggplot object. Additional graphical arguments:
\itemize{
 \item \code{label.pos = FALSE}: will place the willingness to pay label in a different 
 position at the bottom of the graph - base and ggplot2 only (no label in plotly).
 \item \code{point_colors}: a vector of colours specifying the colour(s) associated to 
 the cloud of points. Should be of length 1 or equal to the number of comparisons.
 \item \code{point_size}: a vector of colours specifying the size(s) of the points.
 Should be of length 1 or equal to the number of comparisons.
 \item \code{ICER_colors}: a vector of colours specifying the colour(s) of the ICER points.
 Should be of length 1 or equal to the number of comparisons.
 \item \code{ICER_size}: a vector of colours specifying the size(s) of the ICER points.
 Should be of length 1 or equal to the number of comparisons.
 \item \code{area_include}: logical, include or exclude the cost-effectiveness 
 acceptability area (default is TRUE).
 \item \code{area_color}: a colour specifying the colour of the cost-effectiveness acceptability area.
}}
}
\value{
If \code{graph = "ggplot2"} a ggplot object, or if \code{graph = "plotly"} 
  a plotly object containing the requested plot. Nothing is returned when \code{graph = "base"}, 
  the default.
   
  Grey dots show the simulated values for the joint
  distribution of the effectiveness and cost differentials. The larger red
  dot shows the ICER and the grey area identifies the sustainability area,
  i.e. the part of the plan for which the simulated values are below the
  willingness to pay threshold. The proportion of points in the sustainability
  area effectively represents the CEAC for a given value of the willingness to
  pay. If the comparators are more than 2 and no pairwise comparison is
  specified, all scatterplots are graphed using different colours.
}
\description{
Produces a scatter plot of the cost-effectiveness plane, together with the
sustainability area, as a function of the selected willingness to pay
threshold.
}
\details{
In the plotly version, point_colors, ICER_colors and area_color can also be specified
  as rgba colours using either the \code{\link[plotly]{toRGB}{plotly::toRGB}} function or
  a rgba colour string, e.g. \code{'rgba(1, 1, 1, 1)'}.
}
\examples{

## create the bcea object for the smoking cessation example
data(Smoking)

m <- bcea(e, c, ref = 4, Kmax = 500, interventions = treats)

## produce the base plot
ceplane.plot(m, wtp = 200, graph = "base")

## select only one comparator
ceplane.plot(m, wtp = 200, graph = "base")

## or use ggplot2 instead
if (requireNamespace("ggplot2")) {
   ceplane.plot(m, wtp = 200, pos = "right", ICER_size = 2, graph = "ggplot2")
}
