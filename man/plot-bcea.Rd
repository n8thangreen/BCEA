\usage{
\method{ceac.plot}{bcea}(he, pos = c(1, 0), graph = c("base", "ggplot2", "plotly"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{he}{A \code{bcea} object containing the results of the Bayesian
modelling and the economic evaluation.}

\item{pos}{Parameter to set the position of the legend (only relevant for
multiple interventions, ie more than 2 interventions being compared). Can be
given in form of a string \code{(bottom|top)(right|left)} for base graphics
and \code{bottom}, \code{top}, \code{left} or \code{right} for *ggplot2*.
It can be a two-elements vector, which specifies the relative position on the x
and y axis respectively, or alternatively in form of a logical
variable, with \code{FALSE} indicating to use the default position and
\code{TRUE} to place it on the bottom of the plot. Default value is
\code{c(1,0)}, that is the bottom right corner inside the plot area.}

\item{graph}{A string used to select the graphical engine to use for
plotting. Should (partial-)match the three options \code{"base"},
\code{"ggplot2"} or \code{"plotly"}. Default value is \code{"base"}.}

\item{...}{If \code{graph = "ggplot2"} and a named theme object is supplied,
 it will be added to the ggplot object. Additional arguments:
\itemize{
 \item \code{line_colors}: specifies the line colour(s) - all graph types.
 \item \code{line_types}: specifies the line type(s) as lty numeric values - all graph types.
 \item \code{area_include}: logical, include area under the CEAC curves - plotly only.
 \item \code{area_color}: specifies the AUC colour - plotly only.}}
}
\value{
\item{ceac} {If \code{graph = "ggplot2"} a ggplot object, or if \code{graph = "plotly"} 
  a plotly object containing the requested plot. Nothing is returned when \code{graph = "base"}, 
  the default.} The function produces a plot of the
  cost-effectiveness acceptability curve against the discrete grid of possible
  values for the willingness to pay parameter. Values of the CEAC closer to 1
  indicate that uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness of the reference
  intervention is very low. Similarly, values of the CEAC closer to 0 indicate
  that uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness of the comparator is very low.
}
\description{
Produces a plot of the Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve (CEAC) against
the willingness to pay threshold.
}
\details{
The CEAC estimates the probability of cost-effectiveness, with respect to a
given willingness to pay threshold. The CEAC is used mainly to evaluate the
uncertainty associated with the decision-making process, since it enables the
quantification of the preference of the compared interventions, defined in terms
of difference in utilities.
Formally, the CEAC is defined as:

\deqn{\text{CEAC} = P(\text{IB}(\theta) > 0)}
  
If the net benefit function is used as utility function, the definition can be
re-written as

\deqn{\text{CEAC} = P(k\cdot\Delta_e - \Delta_c > 0)}

effectively depending on the willingness to pay value \eqn{k}.
