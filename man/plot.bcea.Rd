\usage{
\method{plot}{bcea}(
  he,
  comparison = NULL,
  wtp = 25000,
  pos = FALSE,
  graph = c("base", "ggplot2"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{he}{A \code{bcea} object containing the results of the Bayesian
modelling and the economic evaluation.}

\item{comparison}{Selects the comparator, in case of more than two
interventions being analysed. The value is passed to
\code{\link{ceplane.plot}}, \code{\link{eib.plot}} and
\code{\link{ceac.plot}}.}

\item{wtp}{The value of the willingness to pay parameter. It is passed to
\code{\link{ceplane.plot}}.}

\item{pos}{Parameter to set the position of the legend. Can be given in form
of a string, a single logical value, or a two-element vector with the
respective relative positions on the x and y axis. Default as \code{FALSE}
sets the legend position to the default one for each plot (see the details
section), while \code{TRUE} puts it on the bottom of each plot.  Changes
will affect all the individual plots.}

\item{graph}{A string used to select the graphical engine to use for
plotting. Should (partial-)match the two options \code{"base"} or
\code{"ggplot2"}. Default value is \code{"base"}.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to the methods \code{\link{ceplane.plot}}
and \code{\link{eib.plot}}. Please see the manual pages for the individual
functions. Arguments like \code{size}, \code{ICER.size} and \code{plot.cri}
can be supplied to the functions in this way. In addition if
\code{graph="ggplot2"} and the arguments are named theme objects they will
be added to each plot.}
}
\value{
The function produces a plot with four graphical summaries of the
health economic evaluation.
}
\description{
Plots in a single graph the Cost-Effectiveness plane, the Expected
Incremental Benefit, the CEAC and the EVPI
}
\details{
The default position of the legend for the cost-effectiveness plane
(produced by \code{\link{ceplane.plot}}) is set to \code{c(1,1.025)}
overriding its default for \code{pos=FALSE}, since multiple ggplot2 plots
are rendered in a slightly different way than single plots.

# See Baio G., Dawid A.P. (2011) for a detailed description of the 
# Bayesian model and economic problem

# Load the processed results of the MCMC simulation model
data(Vaccine)

# Runs the health economic evaluation using BCEA

                             #  to pay threshold; implies that k is chosen 
                             #  in a grid from the interval (0,Kmax)
       plot=FALSE            # does not produce graphical outputs
      )

# Plots the summary plots for the "bcea" object m using base graphics

##### Example of a customized plot.bcea with ggplot2

  theme = theme(plot.title=element_text(size=rel(1.25))), # theme elements must have a name
  ICER.size = 1.5,                                        # hidden option in ceplane.plot
  size = rel(2.5)                                         # modifies the size of k = labels
  )                                                       # in ceplane.plot and eib.plot
