\usage{

  e,
  c,
  ref = 1,
  interventions = NULL,
  Kmax = 50000,
  wtp = NULL,
  plot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{e}{An object containing \code{nsim} simulations for the variable of
clinical effectiveness for each intervention being considered. In general it
is a matrix with \code{nsim} rows and \code{nint} columns.}

\item{c}{An object containing \code{nsim} simulations for the variable of
cost for each intervention being considered. In general it is a matrix with
\code{nsim} rows and \code{nint} columns.}

\item{ref}{Defines which intervention (columns of \code{e} or \code{c}) is
considered to be the reference strategy. The default value \code{ref = 1}
means that the intervention associated with the first column of \code{e} or
\code{c} is the reference and the one(s) associated with the other column(s)
is(are) the comparators.}

\item{interventions}{Defines the labels to be associated with each
intervention. By default and if \code{NULL}, assigns labels in the form
"Intervention1", ... , "Intervention T".}

\item{Kmax}{Maximum value of the willingness to pay to be considered.
Default value is \code{k = 50000}. The willingness to pay is then approximated
on a discrete grid in the interval \code{[0, Kmax]}. The grid is equal to
\code{wtp} if the parameter is given, or composed of \code{501} elements if
\code{wtp = NULL} (the default).}

\item{wtp}{A(n optional) vector wtp including the values of the willingness
to pay grid. If not specified then BCEA will construct a grid of 501 values
from 0 to Kmax. This option is useful when performing intensive computations
(e.g. for the EVPPI).}

\item{plot}{A logical value indicating whether the function should produce
the summary plot or not.}
}
\value{
An object of the class "bcea" containing the following elements
\item{n.sim}{Number of simulations produced by the Bayesian model}
\item{n.comparators}{Number of interventions being analysed}
\item{n.comparisons}{Number of possible pairwise comparisons}
\item{delta.e}{For each possible comparison, the differential in the
effectiveness measure}
\item{delta.c}{For each possible comparison, the differential in the cost
measure}
\item{ICER}{The value of the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio}
\item{Kmax}{The maximum value assumed for the willingness to pay threshold}
\item{k}{The vector of values for the grid approximation of the willingness
to pay}
\item{ceac}{The value for the Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve,
as a function of the willingness to pay}
\item{ib}{The distribution of the Incremental Benefit, for a given
willingness to pay}
\item{eib}{The value for the Expected Incremental Benefit, as a function of
the willingness to pay}
\item{kstar}{The grid approximation of the break even point(s)}
\item{best}{A vector containing the numeric label of the intervention that
is the most cost-effective for each value of the willingness to pay in the
selected grid approximation}
\item{U}{An array including the value of the expected utility for each
simulation from the Bayesian model, for each value of the grid approximation
of the willingness to pay and for each intervention being considered}
\item{vi}{An array including the value of information for each simulation
from the Bayesian model and for each value of the grid approximation of the
willingness to pay}
\item{Ustar}{An array including the maximum "known-distribution" utility for
 each simulation from the Bayesian model and for each value of the grid
 approximation of the willingness to pay}
\item{ol}{An array including the opportunity loss for each simulation from
the Bayesian model and for each value of the grid approximation of the
willingness to pay}
\item{evi}{The vector of values for the Expected Value of Information, as
a function of the willingness to pay}
\item{interventions}{A vector of labels for all the interventions considered}
\item{ref}{The numeric index associated with the intervention used as
reference in the analysis}
\item{comp}{The numeric index(es) associated with the intervention(s) used
as comparator(s) in the analysis}
\item{step}{The step used to form the grid approximation to the willingness
to pay}
\item{e}{The \code{e} matrix used to generate the object (see Arguments)}
\item{c}{The \code{c} matrix used to generate the object (see Arguments)}
}
\description{
Cost-effectiveness analysis based on the results of a simulation model for a
variable of clinical benefits (e) and of costs (c). Produces results to be
post-processed to give the health economic analysis. The output is stored in
an object of the class "bcea".
