\title{Cost-effectiveness analysis with multiple comparison}
\usage{
multi.ce(he)
}
\arguments{
\item{he}{A \code{bcea} object containing the results of the Bayesian
modelling and the economic evaluation.}
}
\value{
Original bcea object (list) of class "pairwise" with additional:
   \item{p_best_interv}{A matrix including the probability that each
   intervention is the most cost-effective for all values of the willingness to
   pay parameter}
   \item{ceaf}{A vector containing the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier}
}
\description{
Computes and plots the probability that each of the n_int interventions
being analysed is the most cost-effective and the cost-effectiveness
acceptability frontier.

# Runs the health economic evaluation using BCEA

                            #  to pay threshold; implies that k is chosen
