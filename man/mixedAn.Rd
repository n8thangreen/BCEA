\title{Cost-effectiveness analysis when multiple (possibly non cost-effective)
interventions are present on the market}
\usage{
mixedAn(he, mkt.shares = NULL, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{he}{A \code{bcea} object containing the results of the Bayesian
modelling and the economic evaluation.}

\item{mkt.shares}{A vector of market shares associated with the
interventions. Its size is the same as the number of possible comparators.
By default, assumes uniform distribution for each intervention.}

\item{plot}{Logical value indicating whether the function should produce
graphical output, via \code{\link{plot.mixedAn}}, or not. Default is set to
\code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Creates an object in the class \code{mixedAn} which contains the
results of the health economic evaluation in the mixed analysis case:
\item{Ubar}{An array with the simulations of the ''known-distribution''
mixed utilities, for each value of the discrete grid approximation of the
willingness to pay parameter}
\item{OL.star}{An array with the simulations of the distribution of the
Opportunity Loss for the mixed strategy, for each value of the discrete grid
approximation of the willingness to pay parameter}
\item{evi.star}{The Expected Value of Information for the mixed strategy,
for each value of the discrete grid approximation of the willingness to pay
parameter}
\item{k}{The discrete grid approximation of the willingness to pay parameter
used for the mixed strategy analysis}
\item{Kmax}{The maximum value of the discrete grid approximation for the
willingness to pay parameter}
\item{step}{The step used to form the grid approximation to the willingness to pay}
\item{ref}{The numeric index associated with the intervention used as reference
in the analysis}
\item{comp}{The numeric index(es) associated with the intervention(s) used
as comparator(s) in the analysis}
\item{mkt.shares}{The vector of market shares associated with each available
intervention}
\item{n.comparisons}{The total number of pairwise comparisons available}
\item{interventions}{A vector of labels for all the interventions considered}
\item{evi}{The vector of values for the ''optimal'' Expected Value of Information,
as a function of the willingness to pay}

The function can also produce a graph showing the difference between the
''optimal'' version of the EVPI (when only the most cost-effective intervention
is included in the market) and the mixed strategy one (when more than one
intervention is considered in the market)
}
\description{
Runs the cost-effectiveness analysis, but accounts for the fact that more
than one intervention is present on the market
