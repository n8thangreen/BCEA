\usage{
struct.psa(
  models,
  effect,
  cost,
  ref = 1,
  interventions = NULL,
  Kmax = 50000,
  plot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{A list containing the output from either R2jags or
R2OpenBUGS/R2WinBUGS for all the models that need to be combined in the
model average}

\item{effect}{A list containing the measure of effectiveness computed from
the various models (one matrix with n.sim x n.ints simulations for each
model)}

\item{cost}{A list containing the measure of costs computed from the various
models (one matrix with n.sim x n.ints simulations for each model)}

\item{ref}{Which intervention is considered to be the reference
strategy. The default value \code{ref=1} means that the intervention
appearing first is the reference and the other(s) is(are) the comparator(s)}

\item{interventions}{Defines the labels to be associated with each
intervention. By default and if \code{NULL}, assigns labels in the form
"Intervention1", ... , "Intervention T"}

\item{Kmax}{Maximum value of the willingness to pay to be considered.
Default value is \code{k=50000}. The willingness to pay is then approximated
on a discrete grid in the interval \code{[0,Kmax]}. The grid is equal to
\code{wtp} if the parameter is given, or composed of \code{501} elements if
\code{wtp=NULL} (the default)}

\item{plot}{A logical value indicating whether the function should produce
the summary plot or not}
}
\description{
Computes the weights to be associated with a set of competing models in
order to perform structural PSA.
