#' Structural Probability Sensitivity Analysis
#' 
#' Computes the weights to be associated with a set of competing models in
#' order to perform structural PSA.
#' 
#' The model is a list containing the output from either R2jags or R2OpenBUGS /
#' R2WinBUGS for all the models that need to be combined in the model average
#' effect is a list containing the measure of effectiveness computed from the 
#' various models (one matrix with n_sim x n_ints simulations for each model)
#' cost is a list containing the measure of costs computed from the various
#' models (one matrix with n_sim x n_ints simulations for each model).
#' 
#' @param models A list containing the output from either R2jags or
#' R2OpenBUGS/R2WinBUGS for all the models that need to be combined in the
#' model average
#' @param effect A list containing the measure of effectiveness computed from
#' the various models (one matrix with n.sim x n.ints simulations for each
#' model)
#' @param cost A list containing the measure of costs computed from the various
#' models (one matrix with n.sim x n.ints simulations for each model)
#' @param ref Which intervention is considered to be the reference
#' strategy. The default value \code{ref=1} means that the intervention
#' appearing first is the reference and the other(s) is(are) the comparator(s)
#' @param interventions Defines the labels to be associated with each
#' intervention. By default and if \code{NULL}, assigns labels in the form
#' "Intervention1", ... , "Intervention T"
#' @param Kmax Maximum value of the willingness to pay to be considered.
#' Default value is \code{k=50000}. The willingness to pay is then approximated
#' on a discrete grid in the interval \code{[0,Kmax]}. The grid is equal to
#' \code{wtp} if the parameter is given, or composed of \code{501} elements if
#' \code{wtp=NULL} (the default)
#' @param plot A logical value indicating whether the function should produce
#' the summary plot or not
